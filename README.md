## What Is This Thing?  

Imagine being confronted with a code like **"M3A"** or **"K1"** and having to decide: Is this an AWS EC2 instance or a US visa type?  
Yeah, it's bizarre. And that's the beauty of it. We’ve mashed together the world of cloud computing with the thrilling realm of immigration documents to create a quiz that’s as unexpected as it is entertaining.
